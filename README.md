# soundbit
Soundbit is an entirely ad-free and payment-free music streaming and downloading
service built by Connor Goggins. Over 30 million songs are available and instantly
accessible on the platform. All songs are dynamically sourced from YouTube and,
upon request, converted to M4A files and piped to the user using the FFmpeg codec
and various file streaming protocols.

## Getting Started
First, navigate to the project folder and install the Node dependencies:

      npm install

And you're all set! Start the server using the following command:

      node server.js

The site will now be available locally at http://localhost:3000/. Enjoy!
